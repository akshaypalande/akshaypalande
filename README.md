- ðŸ‘‹ Hi,
Hii
Iâ€™m Akshay Arvind Palande, Data Science enthusiast with a good background in Mathematics, Statistics, life sciences, and Data Science. I earned my Master of Science in Data Science and Business Intelligence from Mumbai University, as well as a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology from Mumbai University.

I enjoy learning and sharing what I've learned with others. I have a passion for studying, dissecting, and manipulating data and/or data sets, as well as developing statistical models, in as open a manner as feasible.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hiking, travelling, and listening to various music genres while sipping tea (In no particular order).

All of my projects, micro-projects, skills, certificates, and accomplishments can be found in my Portfolio.
